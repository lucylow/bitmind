## 💻 **Usage Examples**

### **Basic Usage**
```typescript
import { discordNotifications } from '@/lib/discord/discordNotificationService';

// Check if Discord is configured
if (discordNotifications.isEnabled()) {
  await discordNotifications.notifyInvoiceCreated({
    id: '2025-001',
    amount: '0.5 sBTC',
    dao: 'DeFi Protocol DAO',
    payee: 'SP2J6ZY...',

```typescript
import { useDiscordNotifications } from '@/hooks/useDiscordNotifications';

function MyComponent() {

  const handleCreateInvoice = async () => {
    // ... create invoice logic
    
    if (isEnabled) {
      await notifyInvoiceCreated(invoiceData);
    }
  };
}
```

### **Integrated with Blockchain Events**
```typescript
import { createInvoiceWithMonitoring } from '@/lib/hiro/enhancedStacksIntegration';

// Automatically sends Discord notifications on blockchain events
const { txId, monitor } = await createInvoiceWithMonitoring(
  invoiceData,
  userSession
);
// Discord notifications sent automatically! ✨
