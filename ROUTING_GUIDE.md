## Protected Route Behavior

All protected routes use the `<ProtectedRoute>` component which:

1. **Checks wallet connection status**
2. **If not connected:**
   - Shows wallet connection screen
   - Displays supported wallets
   - Provides "Back to Landing Page" option
3. **If connected:**
   - Renders the requested page
   - Full app functionality available

---

## Navigation Components

### LandingPage Navigation
- **Logo** â†’ `/landing`
- **Features** â†’ `#features` (scroll)
- **Demo** â†’ `#demo` (scroll)
- **Dashboard** â†’ `/app`
- **Help** â†’ `/help`
- **GitHub** â†’ External link
- **Launch App** â†’ `/app` (main CTA)

### Main App Navigation (NavigationBar)

---

## Implementation Details

### App.tsx Routing

```typescript
<Routes>
  {/* Landing Page - Entry point */}
  <Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
  <Route path="/landing" element={<LandingPage />} />
  
  {/* Protected Main App */}
  <Route path="/app" element={<ProtectedRoute><Index /></ProtectedRoute>} />
  
  {/* Other protected routes... */}
  <Route path="/dashboard" element={<ProtectedRoute><Dashboard /></ProtectedRoute>} />
  // ... etc
</Routes>
```

### ProtectedRoute Logic

```typescript
const ProtectedRoute = ({ children }) => {
  const { isConnected } = useWalletStore();
  
  if (!isConnected) {
    return <WalletConnectionScreen />;
  }
  
  return <>{children}</>;
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't access protected routes
**Solution**: Connect your wallet via Hiro/Leather/Xverse

### Issue: Wallet connection fails
**Solution**: 
1. Check wallet extension is installed
2. Ensure network is set to testnet/mainnet correctly
3. Try refreshing the page

### Issue: Redirected to landing when wallet is connected
**Solution**: 
1. Check `useWalletStore()` state
2. Verify wallet is actually connected in extension
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting

---

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Remember last route**: After wallet connection, redirect to originally requested page
2. **Onboarding flow**: Multi-step wizard for first-time users
3. **Route permissions**: Different access levels for different wallets
4. **Deep linking**: Direct links to specific features with auto-wallet-prompt
5. **Analytics**: Track user journey through landing â†’ app flow

## Summary

**Landing First Flow** âœ…
- Professional marketing impression
- Clear call-to-action
- Wallet connection when ready
- Seamless transition to app

**URL Structure**:
