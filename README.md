## Project Overview

BitMind is an AI-powered invoice escrow platform designed for DAOs operating on the Bitcoin-native Stacks blockchain. This project automates milestone-based payments using Clarity smart contracts while integrating multi-asset support via tokenized real-world assets (RWA).

The platform simplifies DAO treasury management by providing transparent, automated, and secure invoice processing with built-in dispute resolution. This repository hosts the full application code, smart contracts, detailed mock data for demos, test scenarios, and external API integration examples for rapid development and demonstration.

* * *

## Features

-   AI-powered natural language parsing of invoice requests  
      
    
-   Clarity smart contracts for secure escrow and milestone payments  
      
    
-   Multi-asset support including sBTC and bridged tokens  
      
    
-   Comprehensive dispute resolution with decentralized arbitrators  
      
    
-   Rich mock data enabling full end-to-end demos without backend dependencies  
      
    
-   Public API integration examples without authentication (CoinGecko, IPFS, GitHub)  
      
    
-   Dashboard and user interface components tailored for DAOs and contractors  
      
    
-   Deployment and test scripts for easy local Clarity contract testing  
      
    

* * *

## Demo Data and Documentation

-   Mock Data Files: JSON files containing 50+ sample invoices, DAO treasury stats, and user personas located in the /data folder  
      
    
-   Demo Guide: Detailed documentation in /docs/BitMind\_Demo\_Data\_Guide.md explaining how to leverage mock data for demos and tests  
      
    
-   User Scenarios: UI demo flows including dispute resolution and milestone payments  
      
    

* * *

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js v18 or higher (for frontend and utility scripts)  
      
    
-   Clarity development environment (Clarinet) for contract deployment and testing  
      
    
-   Git for version control  
      
    

## Installation

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitmind-smart-invoice.git

cd bitmind-smart-invoice

npm install

  

## Running the Frontend Demo

bash

npm run start

  

This will launch the UI locally at http://localhost:3000 with mock data loaded from /data.

## Deploy and Test Smart Contracts

bash

cd contracts

clarinet test

  

Run unit and integration tests to validate contract behavior on local stacks testnet.

## Usage

-   Customize the src/api-integration.js to connect external public APIs without keys  
      
    
-   Use mock data in /data for fully functional UI demos  
      
    
-   Deploy smart contracts from /contracts folder to Stacks testnet  
      
    
-   Run scripts in /scripts for deployment or data loading  
      
    
-   Follow the detailed /docs/BitMind\_Demo\_Data\_Guide.md for understanding invoice flows and data  
      
    

* * *

## API Integrations

We provide sample code to integrate public APIs without requiring access keys:

-   [GitHub Public API  
      
    ](https://api.github.com/users/octocat)
    
-   [CoinGecko Cryptocurrency Prices  
      
    ](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin&vs_currencies=usd)
    
-   [IPFS Public Gateway  
      
    ](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmExampleHash)
    

These examples demonstrate lightweight fetch calls and can be extended for your application's needs.

## Smart Contracts

Written in Clarity language, tested with Clarinet:

-   Escrow contract managing funds per invoice and milestones  
      
    
-   Arbitration logic for dispute resolution  
      
    
-   Milestone release and refund mechanisms  
      
    

Refer to /contracts and tests for full source and usage examples.

* * *

## Testing

Execute unit and integration tests with Clarinet:

bash

cd contracts

clarinet test

  

Run frontend tests (if applicable) using your test runner (e.g., Jest).
